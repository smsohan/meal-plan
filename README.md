After many failed attempts to improve my diet plan, I've decided yet
again to take matters seriously. Instead of going after a radical
change, this time I'm going after a balanced approach. Open-sourcing
this plan so that you can fork it and make your own. Or, if you have
suggestions, please feel free to send a PR.

This meal plan is an instance of the suggested serving from [Canada's
Food
Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/canada-food-guides.html) for adult males.
